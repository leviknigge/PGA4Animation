# PGA4Animation

This repository holds the code for my Bachelor Thesis on learned character motion using Plane-Based Geometric Algebra. 

The network structure is based on the AI4Animation at https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation/
However in the end only a feed forward neural network using the phase function as an extra feature was created due to time limitations.

The dataset used can be downloaded from: mocap.cs.cmu.edu/search.php?subjectnumber=%&motion=%

The conversion files have been provided to me by Steven de Keninck, 
he is always open for questions from people interested in PGA and can be found in the bivecor discord on https://bivector.net

The data preprocessing, pytorch network implementation, tensorflow implementation and evaluations used can be found in their corresponding notebook files.
